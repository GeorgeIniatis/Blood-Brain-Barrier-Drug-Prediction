# Blood Brain Barrier Drug Prediction
The brain is surrounded by a permeable boundary that prevents many pathogens from getting in. However, it can also stop many useful drugs from entering the brain. This is especially important when trying to deliver important therapeutics, such as chemotherapy, to brain tumours. Accurate prediction of whether a drug will easily cross the blood-brain-barrier is a valuable tool for developing and testing new drugs for a variety of diseases. 

The aim of this project is to build a machine learning system that takes the chemical structure of a drug and makes a prediction whether it will be able to cross into the brain, passing the barrier, or not.
