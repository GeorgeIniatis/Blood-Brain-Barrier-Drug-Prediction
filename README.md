# Blood Brain Barrier Drug Prediction
The brain is surrounded by a permeable boundary that prevents many pathogens from getting in. However, it can also stop many useful drugs from entering the brain. This is especially important when trying to deliver critical therapeutics, such as chemotherapy, to brain tumours. Accurate prediction of whether a drug will easily cross the blood-brain barrier is a valuable tool for developing and testing new drugs for various diseases. 

This project aims to gather publicly available data on drugs that are known to cross and those that cannot cross into a brain into a new dataset and then, using that dataset build a machine learning system that uses the chemical structure of a drug and predicts whether it can pass the blood-brain barrier.
