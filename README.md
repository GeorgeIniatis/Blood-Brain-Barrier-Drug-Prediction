# Blood Brain Barrier Drug Prediction
The brain is surrounded by a permeable boundary that prevents many pathogens from getting in. However, it can also stop many useful drugs from entering the brain. This is especially important when trying to deliver critical therapeutics, such as chemotherapy, to brain tumours. Accurate prediction of whether a drug will easily cross the blood-brain barrier is a valuable tool for developing and testing new drugs for various diseases. 

This project aims to gather publicly available data on drugs known to cross into the brain and those that cannot and place them into a new dataset. Then using this newly created dataset, build a machine learning system that uses a drugâ€™s chemical structure to predict whether it can pass the blood-brain barrier.
